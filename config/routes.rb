Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  root "welcome#index"

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
  get "/about"  =>  "about#index" , as: :about # can be renamed to e.g :abc and the helper will show it @http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes

  get "/contact" => "contact#index" , as: :contact
  post "/contact" => "contact#create"

  get "/welcome/:name" => "welcome#show", as: :welcome
  


  #if this route is put after the one : get "/welcome/:name" you will never end up using this route
  #simple because the one with :name will match before this one
  #get "/welcome/hello" => "welcome#hello", as: :hello_world


 
  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
